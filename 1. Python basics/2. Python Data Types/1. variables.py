# Creating a variable is always done the same way:

# variable_name = "variable value"

# And you can always delete a variable using:

# del variable_name


# You can't use hyphens, spaces or any alphanumeric characters.
# You can't also start a variable name with a number.

# Example:
favorite_fruit = "apple"
favorite_number = 42
print(favorite_fruit)

print(favorite_number/42)
